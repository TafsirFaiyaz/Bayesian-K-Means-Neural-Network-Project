Bayesian-K-Means-Neural-Project is a hybrid machine learning project that combines Bayesian inference, K-Means clustering, and neural networks to improve data representation and decision-making. It uses probabilistic modeling to handle uncertainty, unsupervised clustering to discover structure in data, and neural networks to learn complex patterns, resulting in a more robust and adaptive learning framework.


Before running the code make sure pytorch, seaborn and scikit-learn are installed.

For that run the below command:
  For pytorch(CPU only):
    pip install torch torchvision torchaudio
    
  For pytorch(Gpu):
    pip install torch torchvision torchaudio --index-url https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cu121

  For seaborn:
    pip install seaborn

  For scikit-learn:
    pip install scikit-learn

To reproduce the result just run the bkdm_nf.py file and for better visualization you can run the bkdm_nf_visualization.ipynb
